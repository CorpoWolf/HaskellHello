## First haskell project.
- The installed haskell tooling is "stack" installed via winget `winget install commercialhaskell.stack`

## Compilation Steps
command: `stack ghc -- hello.hs -o ./build/hello.exe`
command: `rm *.o` and `rm *.hi`


## Git CLI commands:
(Why? Because I need to write these down somewhere so deal with it ðŸ˜‰)
-git init (Initialize the project)


## VSCode Keyboard home controls:
(Why? Because I personally want to avoid moving my hands to mouse or arrow keys)
(Consideration: Windows Powershell / VSCode / Defaults)
